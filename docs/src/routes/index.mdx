# SolidStart

## Why

How we build SolidJS apps right now requires some difficult setup to get everything working together. Let's look at the problems that we need to solve:

- Routing
  - Render-as-you-fetch pattern, start loading data before you start rendering the UI for a route
  - Code-split rendering code for each router
  - Nested Routes
  - Browser-like transitions between routes

export default function Layout(props) {
  return <div class="p-2">{props.children}</div>;
}
