# redirect

##### `redirect` is a helper to create redirect [`Response`][Response] objects

<div class="text-lg">

```tsx twoslash
import { redirect } from "solid-start/server";
// ---cut---
redirect("/my-next-destination");
```

</div>

<table-of-contents></table-of-contents>

## Usage

`redirect` is a helper for creating [responses][Response] objects with the `Location` header and a redirect status code.

It is useful for sending redirects from `createServerData$`, `createServerAction$` and their variants. [API Routes][APIRoutes] can also use it to send redirects.
s
```tsx twoslash
import { redirect } from "solid-start/server";

export function GET() {
  return redirect('/some/other/path');
}
```

## Reference

### `redirect(location: string)`

Use `redirect('/somewhere')` to create a [`Response`][Response] that's going to redirect the user to `/somewhere`. It will set the [Location][Location] header.

It is useful inside [API Routes](/core-concepts/api-routes), [`server$`](/api/server$) functions, and [middleware](/advanced/middleware). Basically wherever a [`Response`][Response] is expected.

```ts twoslash
import { redirect } from "solid-start/server";

const response = redirect('/somewhere');
```
