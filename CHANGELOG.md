# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 08/08/2023

This release has a ton of code changes that had been orphaned on an experimental branch. Mostly around Islands router. Biggest update for those is those feature options are under `experimental` option now, and Islands use `use client`. This may not be the final API but it allows us to take the next steps.

```js
// new config
import solid from "solid-start/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    solid({
      experimental: { islands: true, islandsRouter: true },
    })
  ]
});
```

We have updated Docs, and added Movies and Notes apps. These only really work under this Islands mode and will serve as a basis as we fill in the features as we work on the R&D that is being funding by the Chrome team.

Now that codebase is completely merged, we can resume our rebase effort with all the code in place.

We have also changed the base version of SolidStart to be Node 18. This simplifies the need for polyfills and 16 is end of life next month anyway.
